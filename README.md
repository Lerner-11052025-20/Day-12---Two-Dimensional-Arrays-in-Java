# Day-12---Two-Dimensional-Arrays-in-Java
ðŸ“… Day 12 - Two Dimensional Arrays in Java Welcome to Day 12 of my DSA Fundamentals Series. In this module, I explore Two-Dimensional Arrays (2D Arrays) â€” a crucial concept for matrix-based problems, dynamic programming, and more.

ðŸ“˜ Key Concepts Covered:

What is a 2D Array?
Declaration, Initialization, and Memory Representation
Input & Output Techniques (row-wise & column-wise)
Nested Loops and Traversals
Difference between Rectangular vs Jagged Arrays

ðŸ’» Practical Implementations:
Traversing 2D arrays using nested for loops
Row-wise and column-wise sum
Searching for an element in a matrix
Diagonal traversal and boundary elements
Basic matrix operations (transpose, reverse rows/columns)

ðŸ§  Problem Solving Practice:
Spiral Matrix Traversal
Matrix Transposition
Row with Maximum 1s
Search in Sorted Matrix
Real-world use cases: game boards, image processing, spreadsheets

ðŸ“Š Time & Space Complexity Focus:
Efficient looping techniques
Space trade-offs in large matrix problems
Use of O(n*m) space and time in brute-force vs optimized logic
